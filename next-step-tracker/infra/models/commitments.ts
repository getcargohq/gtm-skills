// The ledger: one row per promise made on a call, by either side.
//
// It is the tracker's whole memory. The repository is read, never written, so
// whether a commitment was already extracted, already closed, or already
// nudged today is answered here and nowhere else:
//   - `commitment_id` is the source entry's path plus a short slug of the
//     promise. Same entry, same promise, same id: a re-run extracts nothing new.
//   - `status` is open, done or dropped. Done only with `closed_evidence`.
//   - `last_nudged_on` is the date the commitment was last posted. A second run
//     on the same day posts nothing.
//
// A native custom model: it deploys with no connector and only the agent that
// owns it writes it.
