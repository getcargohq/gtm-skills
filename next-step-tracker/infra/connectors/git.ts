// Nothing imports this handle. The agent leaves `repository.connector` unset,
// and plan/deploy resolve it from the project's own GitHub connector — this
// one. Bound, not created: `default: true` authorizes nothing, a deploy cannot
// mint an OAuth grant (`cargo-ai cdk add connector/github` does).
