// The tracker: every promise made on a call, kept or chased.
//
// A Claude Code harness agent, because its input is the call log in the
// repository (cadence/log/calls/, written by call-capture) and only a harness
// has a checkout. It reads that checkout and writes nothing back. Its state is
// the commitments model, so a promise is extracted once, closed once, and
// nudged at most once a day, without a pull request to review every morning.
//
// Evidence comes from models declared in this folder, read-only: `gtm_activities`
// (what the team did on each account after a call) and `gtm_accounts` (who owns
// each one). Both are native, so the example deploys with no CRM; a team on
// HubSpot, Salesforce or Attio swaps them for connector-backed models and the
// prompt does not change. Slack is `postMessage` with the channel
// locked, the same way standup locks it: a nudge quotes what a customer said
// on a call, and a channel the agent picks is how that lands in front of them.
//
// No `capabilities`: the repository is the context this agent needs, and the
// prompt holds every read to read-only.
