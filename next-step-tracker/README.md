# Next-step tracker

Every promise made on a recorded call, kept or chased. One Claude Code harness agent reads the call
log `call-capture` writes, records each commitment either side made in a ledger model, closes the
ones the activity log shows were kept, and posts what is due or overdue to one locked Slack channel, at most
once a day.

## What it does

- Reads `cadence/log/calls/` from the last 30 days, on the default branch.
- Records every specific, dated commitment (ours and theirs), quoted, once per entry and promise.
- Closes a commitment only when an email, meeting, note or task in the `gtm_activities` model, or a later call
  entry,
  plainly shows it happened, and cites that record.
- Posts the open ones due today or overdue, grouped by owner, then marks them nudged.
- Writes nothing to the repository and nothing to the evidence models.

| `references/nudge.md`           | (not a resource)                | the message shape and the rule for each line                 |

## Why state in a model and not in the repository

The call entries are call-capture's record, reviewed through pull requests. Ticking their
checkboxes would rewrite that record and open a pull request every morning for the tracker's own
bookkeeping. What changes daily (open, done, nudged today) lives in the `commitments` model, where
it can be queried and corrected without a review.

## Why native models and not a CRM

The example has as few dependencies as it can: the evidence is two native models declared in this
folder, filled by whatever already logs the team's activity. A team on HubSpot, Salesforce or
Attio replaces them with connector-backed models of the same slugs (`crm-backed` in `SKILL.md`);
the agent and its prompt do not change, and no CRM action is ever added to the agent.

## Placeholders (edit before deploy)

1. **`channelId`** in `infra/agents/tracker.ts`: the Slack channel id the nudges land in.
2. **`TRACKER_TIMEZONE` and the cron**: keep the run after call-capture's.
3. **`languageModel`**: any Anthropic model the workspace's connector can reach.

## What it does not do

It does not contact customers, write to any model but its ledger, commit to the repository, or post anywhere but the
locked channel.
