# Ideal customer profile

PLACEHOLDER. This is a worked example for a company selling GTM automation to
technical revenue teams. Replace every line with yours before deploying, and
keep it in the workspace context repo rather than in a prompt or a model
config: the sourcing filter is derived from this file, and so is every tier a
scoring skill writes later.

## Who buys

B2B software, developer infrastructure, and security companies that already run
a technical go-to-market motion, or are visibly staffing one. The buying signal
is a person: a GTM engineer, a technical RevOps lead, or a growth engineer with
a mandate to automate rather than to report.

## Where this came from

Written from the company's own evidence, not from a brainstorm:

- Website and positioning: who the homepage, pricing page and product pages say
  the product is for
- Customer stories: the named customers on the site, and what their case
  studies say they bought it to fix
- Those customers' LinkedIn company pages: the industry, headcount band,
  headquarters and specialties they share

A line below that no customer supports is a hypothesis. Say so next to it.

## Firmographics

Each line maps to an AI Ark filter group, noted in brackets.

- Industry: software development, IT services and consulting, internet and
  technology, computer and network security [`industry`]
- Headcount: 20 to 500 [`employeeSize`]
- Ownership: privately held or public [`companyType`]
- Persona already employed: GTM engineer, growth engineer, revenue, marketing
  or sales operations [`employeeRole`]
- Geography: no restriction, but the buying committee must operate in English
  [`operationLanguage`, if narrowed]

## Disqualifiers

Any one of these puts a company outside the TAM. Express each as a `_not`
filter where AI Ark has the field, so it is never sourced or paid for.

- Above 500 employees. The 500 to 5,000 band is out of scope, not an exception
- Consumer, marketplace, or services-only businesses with no software product
- Agencies and consultancies with no in-house automation practice
- Already committed to a competing platform on a multi-year contract (no
  filter holds this; it is for whoever works the account)
