// The account universe: one row per company AI Ark returned for the approved
// ICP filter. Nothing is written back onto these rows. They join the unified
// accounts model (./accounts.ts) beside the CRM's companies, and that join is
// the whole output: how many companies the market holds, and which of them the
// CRM already has.
//
// THE FILTER IS THE TAM. There is no post-filter and no "source wide, then
// throw away": `fetchCompanies` bills per returned record, so a row outside the
// ICP was already paid for. Narrowing happens here, in `config`, and nowhere
// else.
//
// COUNT BEFORE YOU SOURCE. `aiArk.countCompanies` takes exactly these filter
// groups, returns `{"count": N}` and costs nothing:
//
//   cargo-ai orchestration action execute --wait-until-finished \
//     --action '{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"aiArk","actionSlug":"countCompanies","config":{}}' \
//     --data '{"industry":{"industry_or":["software development"]}, ...}'
//
// Run it for every candidate filter before deploying this. A free number is
// the whole difference between a market you chose and a market you discovered
// after paying for it.
//
// NO SCHEDULE, ON PURPOSE. A cron here re-runs the same search and bills for
// every returned record again, including the rows already sitting in this
// model: a monthly refresh buys the handful of new companies at the price of
// the entire pool. Sourcing is a deliberate spend, triggered when you decide to
// widen.
//
// And if you add a schedule and later delete the line, that does NOT clear a
// live cron: `ScheduleSpec` is optional with no null, the deploy engine omits
// the field when the spec is silent, and the platform keeps whatever cron it
// already has. Clear it at runtime instead:
//   cargo-ai storage model update --uuid <modelUuid> --schedule null

  // an array. Enum-backed fields (industry, seniority, department, funding
  // type, language) must be valid members: resolve them with the integration's
  // autocompletes (`listIndustries`, `listSeniorities`,
  // `listDepartmentsAndFunctions`, `listFundingTypes`) rather than guessing a
