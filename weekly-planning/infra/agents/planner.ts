// The planner: a Claude Code harness agent, not a streamText agent.
//
// `harness: "claudeCode"` swaps the LLM loop for the coding runtime, and that
// is what makes this skill possible. The output of a week is not a column
// value; it is one or more diffs — a raw dump plus one recommendation file
// per active initiative (or one workspace file when there are none). Only an
// agent with a working tree can produce those diffs, and only a pull request
// makes a recommendation reviewable before it is next week's work.
//
// `connector` and `languageModel` are required even here. The harness does not
// bring its own model: it runs against Cargo's LLM proxy, which bills this
// connector and meters usage against this slug. Any Anthropic model works with
// `claudeCode`; see `../connectors/anthropic.ts`.
//
// No `capabilities`, on purpose. The workspace half of the week — whoami, the
// week's runs, credits, what is even deployed — is read with Cargo's own CLI,
// which the harness already has: it clones a CDK project, so `cargo-ai` (or
// its `npx @cargo-ai/cli` form) is right there next to the toolchain that
// project pins, and the plugin's own approval hook already treats those reads
// as the safe class. A capability would be a second path to the same data,
// wired in the release rather than in the prompt, and only the prompt can say
// "read, never execute" — which is the whole point here, because a
// recommendation is markdown a human merges, not a deploy. The commands are
// listed in `planner.prompt.ts` §1b.
