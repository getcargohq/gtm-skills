# Weekly planning

Turn last week's GTM work into recommendation files a reviewer can merge: ranked
against active initiatives, declared infra, and live runs. Collected by a
committed script, judged by a Claude Code harness agent, delivered as one pull
request per initiative — or one workspace pull request when there are none.

## What it does

- **Collects.** `scripts/collect/week.ts` dumps the previous ISO week's git
  commits, pull requests, initiative inventory, declared infra, and cadence
  files dated in that week into `cadence/log/raw/planning/`. Deterministic, no
  LLM anywhere near it.
- **Reads the workspace.** The agent uses the platform capability (runs, usage,
  models). Read-only. If those tools error because the capability is not live
  yet, it notes that on every pull request and continues from the dump.
- **Recommends.** Zero active initiatives: one file, `cadence/plan/<week>.md`.
  N active: one file per initiative, `cadence/plan/<week>-<slug>.md`.
- **Stops.** One unmerged pull request per file. Never a deploy. Never a Slack
  post — standup already owns the daily channel.

## How it works

1. **The cron trigger fires** at 15:00 UTC Monday (8am PT during PDT), after
   Sunday's standup has landed.
2. **The agent clones the repository** — the project's own, resolved from the
   checkout's git origin at deploy rather than written down.
3. **It runs the collector** — `npx tsx scripts/weekly-planning/collect/week.ts`
   — which reads `PLANNING_TIMEZONE` from the harness environment. The agent is
   told not to fetch the week itself.
4. **It reads the workspace** through the platform capability: whoami, last
   week's runs, usage, models.
5. **It writes the plan file(s)** and opens the pull requests from step 2 of
   the prompt: one per active initiative, or one workspace pull request.
6. **A human merges.** The agent never does.

Adds 3 resources plus a script bundle.

| File                               | Resource                     | Role                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `infra/agents/planner.ts`          | `defineAgent` (claudeCode)   | schedule, repository binding, platform capability                 |
| `infra/agents/planner.prompt.ts`   | (not a resource)             | the recap contract: window, one-PR-per-initiative rule, limits    |
| `infra/connectors/git.ts`          | `defineConnector` (`github`) | the clone, branch, push and PR path, resolved by binding          |
| `infra/folders/index.ts`           | `defineFolder`               | the workspace folder this pipeline's resources are filed in       |
| `scripts/collect/week.ts`          | (not a resource)             | the entrypoint: dump git / `gh` / initiatives / infra for the week |

## The two halves, and where they land

This pipeline has one directory per layer it touches, and the install mirrors
each into its namesake in the project:

```
weekly-planning/infra/     ->  infra/weekly-planning/      what is declared and deployed
weekly-planning/scripts/   ->  scripts/weekly-planning/    what the agent runs
```

Those are the layers `cargo-ai cdk init` already scaffolds — `infra/` is the CDK
project, `scripts/` is "imperative glue for runtime surfaces the CDK cannot
declare yet" — so a pipeline that needs both contributes to both under its own
name rather than inventing a third place.

`scripts/package.json` is belt and braces. In a Manifest repo the CDK project
root is `infra/`, so nothing under `scripts/` is ever imported as a resource.
In a project whose CDK root is the repo root, the loader imports every `.ts` it
finds **except** directories carrying a `package.json` — without that file,
`cargo-ai cdk plan` would import the collector and run git/`gh` on every plan.

## Why the split

The collection and the judgement are different jobs, and the failure modes for
mixing them are not symmetric.

A fetch loop an agent re-derives every Monday is a fetch loop that silently
changes shape: a window that drifts, a `gh` flag that quietly widens. Nothing
downstream can tell, because the dump is what everything downstream is diffed
against. So the fetch is a committed script and the agent is told not to
improvise it.

The recommendation is the opposite. It is judgement — which initiative is idle,
whether a declared play ran, who owns the next step — and it produces one diff
per bet. That is what `harness: "claudeCode"` buys: a working tree, the git
history to read before writing, and a pull request. The LLM `connector` and
`languageModel` fields are unused and omitted, because the harness brings its
own model.

## Why one pull request per initiative

A single weekly diff with five initiatives in it is how the loud bet gets
merged and the overdue one rides along unread. Split them, and a reviewer
can merge one and send another back.

Zero active initiatives is the empty-queue case that still has something to
say: the workspace, the infra, the runs. That is one pull request, not zero,
because a quiet repo with plays that ran (or did not) is still a finding.

Unclaimed runs — a play no active initiative names — stay in the dump. They
are not a sixth pull request. Mention them in an initiative file only when they
compete with that initiative.

## Placeholders (edit before deploy)

1. **`PLANNING_TIMEZONE`** — `infra/agents/planner.ts`: IANA timezone the
   previous ISO week is computed in. Change it together with `cron`.

## What it does not do

It does not contact customers, write to a CRM, merge its own pull request,
execute a platform action that spends, deploy, edit or delete a raw dump or an
existing recommendation file, promote first-occurrence claims into `context/`,
or touch `plan/` and `infra/`. It recommends the week; it does not change the
strategy or the deployed engine. It does not post to Slack — that is standup.
