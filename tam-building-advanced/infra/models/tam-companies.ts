// One profile per company: what the profile play read from its LinkedIn page
// and how it classified it. Same columns whatever source found the company.

// It is also what makes the sources one market. Sales Navigator knows a
// company by its LinkedIn id, AI Ark and Apollo by its domain and LinkedIn page
// name, Exa by its website. This row carries all three, and it unifies into
// Accounts too, so every source's row for the same company lands on one
// account.
//
// `status` and `exclusion_reason` are computed from settings.ts: the
// classifier labels the company, these columns decide what the label means.
// Nothing is deleted; read the TAM as `status = 'in_scope'`.

// The row the two computed columns read. Native columns are typed only after
// `cargo-ai project types` has seen the model, so they are spelled out here.
