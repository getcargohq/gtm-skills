/**
 * What has to hold about this cookbook, checked on every run of
 * `npm run validate` (scripts/check-pipelines.mjs executes this file).
 *
 * Three parts. The registry checks the compiled resources for the boundaries
 * CDK schema validation cannot express: one harness agent on a monthly cron
 * with the Slack channel locked, the CRM models it reads, and no connector
 * for a system this cookbook must not read. The models check that every
 * model pulls all the data, with no filter in its config, and that the
 * shared CRM models are declared exactly as the other CRM cookbooks declare
 * them. The audit checks the SQL in the prompt: read-only, over the three
 * models, narrowed to closed deals, no amount, no email.
 *
 * Run it from the skill folder after every adaptation:
 *   node --import tsx evals/contract.mjs
 *
 * It loads through `loadResources`, the same loader `cargo-ai cdk check`,
 * `plan`, and `deploy` use, so what is asserted here is what would deploy.
