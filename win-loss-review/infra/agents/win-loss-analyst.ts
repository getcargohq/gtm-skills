// The win-loss review agent: a Claude Code harness agent on a monthly cron, and
// run by hand once for the first pass.
//
// `harness: "claudeCode"` swaps the LLM loop for the coding runtime, and that
// is what makes this cookbook possible. The output of a month is not a column
// value; it is a diff across markdown files: an ICP verified against won and
// lost, dated insights with denominators, objections from lost reasons,
// clients from closed-won, plus the record of each run under outputs/. Only
// an agent with a working tree can produce that diff, and only a pull request
// makes it reviewable before it becomes what every other agent believes.
//
// `connector` and `languageModel` are required even here. The harness does not
// bring its own model: it runs against Cargo's LLM proxy, which bills this
// connector and meters usage against this slug. Any Anthropic model works with
// `claudeCode`; see `../connectors/anthropic.ts`.
//
// Slack is a Cargo connector action on `uses`, not a script and not a wrapped
// tool. `channelId` is locked the same way `mailboxUuid` is locked on
// sendEmail: if it were a field the agent filled, a mistype would post the
// month's lost deals into a customer channel. format and disableUnfurling
// are locked with it; the agent fills `body`. The digest is five lines, so a
// teammate reads it in ten seconds and opens the pull request when a line
// surprises them.
//
// No `repository` block, and nothing left to put in one. Plan and deploy
// fill the repo, branch, root and GitHub connector from the git origin of
// the checkout, which is the correct binding: the repository holding
// context/ and outputs/ IS this CDK project's. `cargo-ai cdk check` prints
// what it resolved; confirm the root is the repository root and not
// `infra/`.
//
// No `env` either, and no script. The CRM is extracted by the platform into
// the three models under ../models/, and the audit is fixed SQL over them in
// ./win-loss-analyst.prompt.ts, with the lost-reason column and the verify
// line beside it. The agent runs those queries through `cargo-ai`, which the
// sandbox is signed in to, so there is no credential anywhere in this
// cookbook.
//
// No `capabilities`. The audit is read with `cargo-ai storage query`, and the
// one thing this agent must never do is write the workspace context
// directly: a `context` capability here would be a second write path that
// skips the pull request.
