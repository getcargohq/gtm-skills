// The git provider the agent clones through, and pushes its branch and
// opens its pull request with. Its OAuth grant carries the `repo` scope, so
// this one connector is the agent's entire write path into the repository:
// it appends to context/ every month and has no other way to land anything.
//
// Nothing imports this handle. That is deliberate: the agent leaves
// `repository.connector` unset, and plan/deploy resolve it from the project's
// own GitHub connector, which is this one. Declaring it is what makes it
// exist; wiring it by hand would only re-state what the resolver already
// knows.
//
// Bound, not created. `default: true` authorizes nothing: you grant it once in
// the browser (`cargo-ai cdk add connector/github`) and this declaration binds
// to it. A deploy cannot mint an OAuth grant.
