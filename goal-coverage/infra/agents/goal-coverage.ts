// Goal coverage: a Claude Code harness agent, not a streamText agent.
//
// The question it answers once a week is "what does our goal need that this
// workspace has not built?", and the answer has to be remembered: a scoring
// model suggested and declined last week must not come back next week. That
// memory is a file in the repository, cadence/coverage/<week>.md, edited by
// the reviewer before merging. Only an agent with a working tree can write it,
// and only a pull request lets a human decline a suggestion in writing.
//
// It does not grade the work that already exists. That is weekly-planning.
// The two run in different weeks of thought: planning asks whether the bets we
// have are on track, coverage asks which bets the goal needs that we have not
// placed.
//
// `connector` and `languageModel` are required even here. The harness does not
// bring its own model: it runs against Cargo's LLM proxy, which bills this
// connector and meters usage against this slug.
//
// Slack is a Cargo connector action on `uses`, with `channelId` locked: a
// mistyped channel would post internal suggestions into a customer channel.
//
// No `capabilities`, on purpose. What is deployed (plays, agents, models,
// connectors, folders) is read with Cargo's own CLI, which the harness already
// has, and only the prompt can say "read, never execute". The commands are
// listed in `goal-coverage.prompt.ts` §2. The CLI is signed in as the
// `goal_coverage` service user (`repository.runAs`), a viewer: see `../users`.
