// The tiering agent: one judgment per company in the TAM.
//
// An agent instead of point weights, because the question that separates an A
// from a C is not arithmetic. "Does this company already run the motion we
// sell into" is answered by an open role, a changelog or an engineering post,
// and no sourced column holds it. Anything the sourced firmographics DO settle
// (headcount band, industry, country) belongs in tam-building's filter, where
// applying it costs nothing.
//
// Two capabilities do the work:
//   - `context` (read-only) connects the agent to the ICP and the tiering
//     rubric. Without it the prompt's reference to them reads nothing, and the
//     agent invents a rubric that sounds plausible for every account.
//   - `webSearch` turns a thin row into a decidable one. It resolves one stated
//     doubt; it never fills in a firmographic the search did not return.
//
// The rubric is deliberately NOT in this prompt. It lives in the project's
// context repo, so changing what tier A means is a reviewed commit rather than
// a deploy, and a rep can read the same file the agent read. This skill's
// `context/tiering-rubric.md` is the example to put there.
//
// No writable model in `uses`, and none should be added. The agent hands back a
// judgment and the play persists it. An agent that can write decides its own
// routing, and then a missing tier could be a failed run, a skip, or a choice.
