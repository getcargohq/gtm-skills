// and the workflow does not branch on it again.
//
// `changeKinds: ["added"]` is the cost control. Runs are created for rows
// entering the filter, not for the whole book on every tick, so steady state

// cron fires instead of with how many companies arrived.
//
// Cron, not watch or realtime: `fetchCompanies` is a plain fetch extractor, so
// realtime needs an ingest-mode extractor and watch needs `isWatchable` (both
// fail at deploy with integrationNotCompatible). Hourly, because the model has
// no schedule of its own: rows land whenever someone syncs, and an untiered
// row sits outside the tier segments until the next tick.
//
// Ships disabled. Pilot a sample through the workflow first
// (references/run.md), then enable and execute once: `added` does not backfill
// the rows that were already there while the play was off.
