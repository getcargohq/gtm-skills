// The shared LLM provider. Agents reference it via `connector`. Bound, not
// created: `default: true` links the workspace's existing OpenAI connector (the
// one key-authenticated in the UI), so this example deploys with no env var of
// its own. Swap for anthropic/gemini and update each agent's `languageModel`
// accordingly.
//
// The integration slug is "openAi", not "openai". Binding declares no `config`,
// so the wrong casing typechecks green and only fails at deploy.
