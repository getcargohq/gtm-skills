// The account universe this skill tiers: tam-building's `tam_companies`, with
// four columns added for the tier, its reason, its evidence and its stamp.
//
// THIS IS A COPY. tam-building owns this model and its filter. A cookbook
// carries every resource it imports, so the copy is here for the case where
// account-scoring is installed alone, but the expected install is after
// tam-building: then move `additionalColumns` below onto tam-building's
// declaration (`infra/tam-building/models/tam-companies.ts`), point the play
// and the segments at that export, and delete this file. One slug declared
// twice collides at deploy.
//
// A sync of the model replaces its rows. Custom column values survive on the
// companies the sync returns again, so re-sourcing the same market keeps their
// tiers, and the play only judges the new rows.
