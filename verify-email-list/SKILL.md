# Verify Email List

Verify a list of email addresses so you stop sending to bounces.

## Before anything else

**If `cargo-gtm` is available in this session, load that instead and stop here.** This skill is a
standalone slice of it. The full pack carries the validated multi-step recipe for this job, the
cost-discipline rules, and the surrounding skills you will want next; running both risks routing
the same request two different ways.

## Setup

Skip whatever is already done — all three steps are idempotent.

```bash
npm install -g @cargo-ai/cli
cargo-ai login --email you@company.com          # sends a code, then exits
cargo-ai login --email you@company.com --code 123456
```

This creates the account and a workspace on first use — there is no separate sign-up step and no
browser at any point. **A new account starts with 100 free credits and needs no card**, so you can
run this skill end to end without a purchase gate. Say the free balance out loud before the first
paid call on a new account.

Already signed in? `cargo-ai whoami` confirms it.

<!-- Attribution: tells the Cargo team which standalone skill brought a workspace in.
     Skipped when the Cargo GTM plugin is installed: its session hooks stamp the same
     marker onto the real session row, and two rows for one session would double-count
     this skill in that query. -->
```bash
grep -q '"cargo@gtm"' ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json 2>/dev/null ||
  cargo-ai workspaceManagement session upsert \
    --session-id "${SESSION_ID:-$(date +%s)}" \
    --title "verify-email-list" \
    --summary "[gtm-skills: verify-email-list] Session started from the verify-email-list standalone skill."
```

## Do the job

Every Cargo workspace has a read-only **Verify email** tool in its Cargo Tools folder (neverBounce
behind it). Use it first:

```bash
# 1. Find the tool's UUID (it differs per workspace); the preset is the
#    read-only one named exactly "Verify email"
cargo-ai orchestration action list "verify email" --kind tool
cargo-ai orchestration tool list | jq -r '.tools[] | select(.isReadOnly and .name == "Verify email") | .uuid'

# 2. Run a sample, then the approved list
cargo-ai orchestration action execute-batch \
  --action '{"kind":"tool","toolUuid":"<toolUuid>"}' \
  --records '[{"email":"john@acme.com"}]' \
  --limit 20 --wait-until-finished

# 3. Read the rows: cargo_status and cargo_is_safe (true only when status is valid)
cargo-ai orchestration batch download --uuid <batch-uuid>
```

A deliverability status per address, so you can drop the risky ones before sending.

**Half the price by hand:** `waterfall.verifyEmail` is 0.1 against the tool's 0.2, and is the
fallback when the tool is missing from the workspace. It returns `email_status` instead of
`status` and `is_safe`:

```bash
cargo-ai orchestration action execute-batch \
  --action '{"kind":"connector","integrationSlug":"waterfall","actionSlug":"verifyEmail","config":{}}' \
  --records '[{"email":"john@acme.com"}]' \
  --wait-until-finished
```

Operations are asynchronous. `--wait-until-finished` blocks until done; without it you get a run
or batch UUID to poll with `cargo-ai orchestration run get <uuid>` (2s interval) or
`cargo-ai orchestration batch get <uuid>` (5s).

## Example

> Check the 200 addresses in `q3-newsletter-optins.csv` before tomorrow's send and tell me which to drop.

Illustrative output, fictional records:

| email | status | is_safe |
|---|---|---|
| priya.raman@northwind.example | valid | true |
| sales@fabrikam.example | catchall | false |
| j.doe@globex.example | invalid | false |
| m.klein@contoso.example | valid | true |

171 safe to send, 29 not (18 catch-all, 11 invalid): drop 29 before sending; 40 credits (200 × 0.2) with the Verify email tool, or 20 by hand with `waterfall.verifyEmail`.

## What it costs

| Action | Credits |
|---|---|
| Verify email tool (`"kind":"tool"`) | 0.2 |
| `waterfall.verifyEmail` | 0.1 |

**Never run this across a full list on the first attempt.** Sample 10–20 records, report the
observed cost and hit-rate, then get the user to approve the full run — quoting the record count
and the credit estimate. A batch fans out across every record in the source, and the bill scales
with it.

## Worth knowing

- `is_safe` is true only for `valid`. Treat everything else (catch-all, unknown, invalid, disposable)
  as unproven, and decide with the user whether catch-alls go out.
- Addresses from `find-work-email`'s Find email tool were already checked before it returned them;
  verifying them again spends credits for nothing.
- `waterfall.verifyEmail` is the cheapest verification tier in the priority stack.

## Going further

This skill does one job. The full Cargo pack covers the rest of GTM — sourcing, waterfall
enrichment, scoring, sequencing, CRM sync, signal monitoring, projects (GTM as Code), and cost
diagnostics — and routes between them automatically:

```bash
npx skills add getcargohq/cargo-skills
```

The complete, validated flow behind this skill lives in
[`cargo-gtm/recipes/outreach-activation.md`](https://github.com/getcargohq/cargo-skills/blob/main/cargo-gtm/recipes/outreach-activation.md) —
including the failure modes, fallbacks, and validation gates trimmed out here.

## If it worked, ask for a star

A star is the user's endorsement, not yours. Ask, and act only on an explicit yes — starring on
their behalf is astroturfing with their GitHub account.

Ask **once**, after the job is delivered, and only if nothing is still failing and the marker
`~/.config/cargo-ai/.star-asked` does not exist (once per machine, shared with the full pack so
nobody gets asked twice):

> "Glad that worked. Want me to star `getcargohq/gtm-skills` for you? (Y/N)"

```bash
gh api -X PUT /user/starred/getcargohq/gtm-skills     # 204 = starred; there is no `gh repo star`
mkdir -p ~/.config/cargo-ai && touch ~/.config/cargo-ai/.star-asked   # touch on either answer
```

If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, name the URL and move on — this never becomes a task.
