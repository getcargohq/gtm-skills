# Web capture

Keep the knowledge layer current from the one source every company has on day one: the web, about
itself and its competitors. One Claude Code harness agent and its prompt, one pull request a week.

## What it does

- **Reads the web, the same way every week.** Two `cargo-ai` commands generated in the prompt: one
  `parallel.extract` with `fullContent` over the company's own pages and each competitor's watched
  pages, and one `parallel.createTask` news question about all of them for the days since the last
  merged read. A fixed `node -e` line writes each page to `cadence/log/raw/web/pages/<page>.md` or
  `cadence/log/raw/web/competitors/<competitor>/<page>.md`, and the news to
  `cadence/log/raw/web/news/<date>.json`. No text passes through the agent on its way to disk.
- **Lets git say what changed.** `git diff` against the default branch shows which pages changed;
  a news URL not in an earlier file is new.
- **Seeds once.** The first run fills every empty `context/` domain: `global/`, `icp/` with a
  disqualifier, `alternative/`, `client/`, `proof/`, `signal/`. Every sentence tagged `[R]`, `[I]`
  or `[TR]`.
- **Adds what changed.** Every run after writes one dated `insight/<date>-web.md`, each line naming
  its company, plus a file for a newly named customer or competitor. It never edits a file that
  exists; a change to one is a proposal in the pull request body.
- **Stops.** One pull request, never merged, or none in a quiet week. Nothing here reads a CRM, a
  call or Slack.

Adds 4 resources and no script.

| File                                | Resource                        | Role                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `infra/agents/web-scribe.ts`        | `defineAgent` (claudeCode)      | the scribe: model, folder, weekly cron, no env                                 |
| `infra/agents/web-scribe.prompt.ts` | (not a resource)                | the whole procedure: domain, pages, competitors, the exact commands, the rules |
| `infra/connectors/anthropic.ts`     | `defineConnector` (`anthropic`) | the model the harness runs on, billed and metered                              |
| `infra/connectors/git.ts`           | `defineConnector` (`github`)    | the clone, branch, push and PR path, resolved by binding                       |
| `infra/folders/index.ts`            | `defineFolder`                  | the workspace folder the agent is filed in                                     |

## Why no script

The other capture cookbooks read their source with a committed collector, because a fetch loop an
agent re-derives each week silently changes shape. Here the reads are two fixed commands, so the
prompt carries them exactly, and git already does the one thing a collector would add: comparing
this week to the last. What keeps the comparison honest is mechanical: `fullContent` returns the
whole page rather than excerpts chosen for a question, and a `node -e` line writes the files from
the command output, so the agent never retypes a page. Both were checked live: two reads of the same
pages a minute apart were byte-identical.

## Why competitors are in the default

A company already knows its own launches, pricing and funding; it made them. What a weekly read
catches that the team does not already know is a competitor changing its pricing or shipping
something. Same two reads, one more set of URLs, and the findings land in `insight/` with the
competitor's name and in proposals against its `alternative/` file.

## Why the baseline is the last merged read

The harness clones the default branch, so the only read a run can diff against is one that was
merged. A quiet week opens no pull request and commits nothing, which is why the news window starts
at the date of the last commit under `cadence/log/raw/web/` rather than a fixed seven days: the next
run covers the gap. It is also why the first run always opens a pull request, even when every domain
was already seeded.

## Why one source

A cookbook is a prebuilt approach an agent follows. Give it a page and a deal in one run and the
reader cannot tell the two confidence levels apart afterwards. So this cookbook holds one: what is
public, tagged as such. The CRM has `win-loss-review`, which verifies the ICP this seeds; calls
have `call-capture`.

## Placeholders (edit before deploy)

1. **`DOMAIN`**, **`PAGES`** and **`COMPETITORS`** in `infra/agents/web-scribe.prompt.ts`. The agent
   refuses the placeholder domain; `COMPETITORS` ships empty.
2. **`languageModel`** on the agent.

## What it does not do

It does not read a CRM, a call, an inbox or Slack; write the workspace context directly; edit a
file that exists; write a page by hand; contact anyone; or merge its own pull request.

## Verify

From this skill's folder:

```sh
node --import tsx evals/contract.mjs
```

From the project root:

```sh
npm run check && cargo-ai cdk plan
```
