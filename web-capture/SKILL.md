# Web capture

**State: to-be-approved.** Deploy-verified against a live workspace: not yet. Treat `Done when`
below as the acceptance test and review `cargo-ai cdk plan` before deploying. Make no outcome claim
for this skill until it is approved.

## The outcome

What the company and its competitors say on the web, and what the web says about them, stops
drifting away from what every agent reads. Once a week one agent runs, and lands it in your
repository:

1. **The raw reads.** One `parallel.extract` call reads the company's own pages (home, pricing,
   customers, careers, blog, changelog) and each competitor's watched pages (usually pricing and
   changelog), in full. One `parallel.createTask` news question covers all of them for the days
   since the last merged read. A fixed `node -e` line writes each page to its own file under
   `cadence/log/raw/web/` and the news to `cadence/log/raw/web/news/<date>.json`; no text passes
   through the agent. `git diff` against the default branch is what says a page changed.
2. **The context files.** The first run seeds every empty domain: `global/` (positioning, value
   proposition, offerings), `icp/` as an inferred profile with at least one disqualifier,
   `alternative/`, `client/`, `proof/` and `signal/` candidates. Every run after adds one dated
   `insight/<date>-web.md` with what changed that week, for the company and each competitor, plus
   a `client/` or `alternative/` file for a newly named customer or competitor. It never edits a
   file that exists: a change to one is a proposal in the pull request body.

Then it opens one pull request and stops. A human merges, and the next `cargo-ai cdk deploy` syncs
`context/` into the workspace context repository, which is where every other Cargo agent reads
before it acts. A week with nothing worth writing opens no pull request.

Every factual sentence carries an evidence tag: `[R: <url>]` receipted by a page, `[I: <from
what>]` inferred, `[TR: <what would settle it>]` unknown. Public pages are one source, so nothing
here is stated with the conviction of a deal; `win-loss-review` is what later verifies the ICP
against won and lost.

The whole cookbook is one agent and its prompt. There is no collector script: the prompt spells out
the exact commands, generated from the domain, the pages and the competitors at the top of the
prompt file, and git does the diffing. Three properties make it safe enough to run unattended:

- **The reads are fixed and mechanical.** The same two commands every week, the full page content
  (not excerpts, which change with the question asked), and files written by code rather than
  retyped by the agent. Two reads a minute apart came back byte-identical, so a diff is a change on
  the site. The news window starts at the last merged read, so a quiet week is covered by the next
  run rather than skipped.
- **The pull request is the gate.** The agent has repository write access and nothing else: no
  workspace context write, no CRM, no email, no Slack, no merge.
- **Append-only after the first run.** Existing files are never edited, so what a human corrected
  stays corrected.

## Example

> Every Monday, read our website, our competitors' pricing and changelog pages, and the news about all of us, and keep context/ current.

Illustrative output, fictional records:

```

A week after the first run: one pull request, four findings across two companies, two new files, two
proposed edits, and two reads billed (the pages and the news).

## Put it in your project

This folder is a **worked example**: real CDK resources written for some other company. The job is
to end up with the code your company would have written, in your project, and an agent does the
adapting. If the `cargo-cdk` skill is in your session it carries the long form of this; if not, this
is enough.

1. **Install it: the CLI does the copy.** From inside the CDK project,
   `cargo-ai cdk add cookbook/web-capture` writes the resources to `infra/web-capture/` and this
   procedure to `.claude/skills/web-capture/`. No project yet?
   `cargo-ai cdk init <dir> --cookbook web-capture && cd <dir> && npm install` does both; this
   folder never ships a shell. **If you are reading this from the project's `.claude/skills/`, the
   install already happened: start at step 2.** On a CLI too old to have `add`, copy this folder in
   as a sibling of what is there by hand; everything below is unchanged.
2. **Reconcile it with what is already declared.** If the project already has a GitHub or
   Anthropic connector or an agents folder, rewire the imports to the existing one and drop the
   copy; two resources with one slug is a collision at deploy. The knowledge layer needs no work:
   the scaffold already declares the repo's root `context/` in `infra/context.ts`, and
   `defineContext` is a per-workspace singleton, which is why this folder ships none. **Append
   nothing to `.env.example`:** nothing here holds a credential.
3. **Set the domain, the pages and the competitors.** In `infra/agents/web-scribe.prompt.ts` (at
   `infra/web-capture/agents/web-scribe.prompt.ts` once installed), set `DOMAIN` to the company's
   own domain, `PAGES` to the site's real sections (the sitemap lists them), and `COMPETITORS` to
   the competitors worth watching with their pricing and changelog URLs. The agent refuses to run on
   the placeholder domain; with no competitors it watches the company alone and says so in every
   pull request.
4. **Adapt.** Work the sections below in order: _What should not change_ is what you argue back
   about (say what breaks, then do it if they still want it); _What you can change_ is what you
   offer unprompted; _What you will be asked_ is the floor, and you derive before you ask. Set the
   model. Record what you changed and why under a `## Decisions` section in your copy of this file.
5. **Plan, then stop.** `node --import tsx evals/contract.mjs` from this skill's folder, then
   `npm run check && cargo-ai cdk plan` from the project root (`check` validates the resource tree
   offline; the blank template ships it). Show the diff: one agent, two bound connectors, one
   folder, and no model. Deploy only on an explicit yes: `cargo-ai cdk deploy`. Never
   `cdk init --force` into a non-empty directory.
6. **Run the first one by hand.** From the workspace UI or with
   `cargo-ai ai message create --agent-uuid <uuid> --parts '[{"type":"text","text":"Run the web capture. Follow your system prompt exactly."}]'`.
   The first run always opens a pull request: its page and news files are the baseline every later
   week is diffed against, and they only count once merged. The Monday cron takes it from there.
7. **Verify.** Walk _Done when_ line by line and report each with evidence.

## What you will be asked

**Derive before you ask.** An input with a lookup is looked up, not asked. Only the rows marked
_asked_ genuinely live in the operator's head.

| Input                                                     | Kind  | How it is answered                                                                                                                                                                              | Why it matters                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| domain (`DOMAIN` in `infra/agents/web-scribe.prompt.ts`)  | value | **derived** from the workspace name, `context/global/` or the repository README. **asked** only when none of them names one                                                                     | Every file the agent writes is about this company; a wrong domain is a wrong knowledge base. The agent refuses the placeholder |
| pages (`PAGES`, same file)                                | value | **derived** from the site's sitemap: the sections that say what is sold, to whom, at what price, for which customers, and what shipped                                                          | A page not listed is a change never seen                                                                                       |
| competitors (`COMPETITORS`, same file)                    | value | **derived** from `context/alternative/` when it is seeded, with each competitor's pricing and changelog URLs from their sitemaps. **asked** only to confirm which are worth watching every week | Competitors' pricing and launches are what a weekly read catches that the team does not already know. At most 20 URLs in all   |
| LLM connector and model (`infra/connectors/anthropic.ts`) | value | **derived**: `cargo-ai connection connector list` shows whether an Anthropic connector is authorized; the agent's `languageModel` is a placeholder to set                                       | A harness does not bring its own model; this is what the weekly run is billed and metered against                              |
| repository binding (`infra/agents/web-scribe.ts`)         | value | **derived**: leave `repository` unset and `plan` fills it from the git origin of the checkout. `cargo-ai cdk check` prints what it resolved: confirm the repository root                        | It is the working tree the agent diffs against the default branch, and the only place its output can land                      |

Checked before moving on, not after the deploy:

- `DOMAIN` is the company's own domain, and `PAGES` and `COMPETITORS` name pages that exist
- the contract passes, which includes the 20-URL limit
- `cargo-ai cdk check` prints the agent bound to the repository root, not `infra/`
- exactly one `defineContext` in the project, the scaffold's, resolving to the root `context/`

## What you can change

The code is a worked example. These reshapes are expected, and the agent offers them rather than
waiting to be asked. Every one costs something; that is what makes it a variation and not the
default.

| Variation      | When it is right                                                           | How                                                                                                                 | What it costs                                                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `more_pages`   | Product, solution or docs pages say what is sold better than the home page | Add them to `PAGES` or a competitor's entry in `infra/agents/web-scribe.prompt.ts`                                  | One more URL billed on every read, more candidate changes for the agent to read, and the 20-URL cap |
| `daily`        | The company or a competitor ships several times a week                     | Change the cron in `infra/agents/web-scribe.ts`                                                                     | Five times the reads, and most days open no pull request                                            |
| `slack_digest` | The team does not watch pull requests                                      | Add a Slack connector and a locked `postMessage` use on the agent, as standup does, and a digest step to the prompt | One more connector to keep authorized, and a channel to choose                                      |
| `deeper_news`  | The `lite` search misses coverage the team knows about                     | Change `processor: "lite"` to `"base"` in `newsData` in the prompt file                                             | The next rung of the processor price ladder on every run; read it live before switching             |

## What should not change

However far you adapt, these hold. Ask for one anyway and the agent tells you what breaks, then does
it if you still want it, and records why under `## Decisions` in your copy of this file.

- **The web is the only source.** (`web-scribe.prompt.ts`) No CRM, no calls, no inbox, no Slack.
  Each is another cookbook's evidence; mix one in here and a page and a deal end up in one file at
  one confidence nobody can tell apart afterwards.
- **The reads are the commands in the prompt, with `fullContent`, and code writes the files.**
  (`web-scribe.prompt.ts`) Excerpts change with the question asked, and an agent that retypes a page
  truncates and tidies it; either makes every week look like a change on the site.
- **`outputSchema` stays a string.** (`web-scribe.prompt.ts`) The news action takes the JSON schema
  as a string; an object fails its validation and the week reads no news.
- **Existing files are never edited.** (`web-scribe.prompt.ts`) What a human corrected stays
  corrected. A change to an existing file is a proposal in the pull request body.
- **The one-PR write path.** (`infra/agents/web-scribe.ts`) The agent never writes the workspace
  context directly and has no `context` capability: the repository is the source and
  `cargo-ai cdk deploy` syncs it.
- **The first run always opens a pull request.** (`web-scribe.prompt.ts`) Its page and news files
  are the baseline. Until they are merged, every run reads as a first run and nothing is ever a
  change.
- **Every claim is tagged.** (`web-scribe.prompt.ts`) `[R]`, `[I]` or `[TR]`, and missing evidence
  is never contradicting evidence.

## Done when

- `DOMAIN`, `PAGES` and `COMPETITORS` name the company, its real sections and the competitors worth
  watching, and the contract passes
- `cargo-ai cdk check` prints the agent bound to the repository root, and `cargo-ai cdk plan`
  reports one agent, two bound connectors, one folder and no model
- the first run opened one pull request with the page, competitor and news files, seeded every empty
  domain, and edited no existing file
- every seeded file carries tags, `icp/` names a disqualifier, and every `client/` file carries
  `reference_permission: unknown`
- after the baseline was merged, a run with a change opened a pull request adding
  `insight/<date>-web.md` with one tagged line per finding, each naming its company, and proposed
  rather than made any edit to an existing file
- a run with nothing worth writing opened no pull request
- after merging and `cargo-ai cdk deploy`, a seeded file is readable from the workspace context
  repository and an agent with the `context` capability quotes it back with its tag

## What it costs

Fetch live prices before every estimate: `cargo-ai connection integration get parallel`, plus the
LLM connector's model. Quote the lookup time with the estimate.

Each run bills two reads: one `parallel.extract` over every listed URL, the company's and the
competitors' (billed per URL, a 404 included), and one `parallel.createTask` on the `lite`
processor, the cheapest rung of its price ladder. Plus the harness run, which scales with how much
changed.

## Composes into

`tam-building` and `account-scoring` (they read the ICP this writes down: one to source the market,
the other to score the book), `new-hire-detection` (it qualifies the company each new hire joined
against that ICP), `website-building` (the positioning this captures is what the pages say),
`win-loss-review` (verifies the ICP this seeds against won and lost deals, and proposes the
corrections), and any agent with the `context` capability.
