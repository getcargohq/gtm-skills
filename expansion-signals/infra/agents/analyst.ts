// The analyst: one judgment per account whose won deal just entered its
// renewal window.
//
// The play hands it a won deal ten to twelve months old. The rest is SQL over
// the deals model: is this still the account's latest win (or did a newer one
// already renew it), what is the cadence across its wins, what did it pay
// last time. Then the question no column holds: is anything outside (a
// funding round, a hiring push, a new product, a new leader) giving the
// account manager a reason to call now.
//
// It reads, it never writes. Both models are read-only here, the
// playbook for what counts as an expansion moment is in the workspace context,
// and web search settles the outside signals. The play persists the judgment;
// an agent that could write would decide its own routing, and a missing
// signal could then be a failed run, a skip, or a choice.
