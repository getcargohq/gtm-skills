// It runs hours after the play and reads only the accounts model, where the
// play wrote `cargo_expansion_*`. It re-judges nothing: the reason on the
// account is the reason in the digest, so a rep who opens the record reads the
// same words.
//
// The ledger is checked before posting and appended after, so a re-run the
// same week posts nothing and a failed post is retried next run.
