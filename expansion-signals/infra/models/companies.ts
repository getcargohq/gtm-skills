// The customer book: a native account model, so the worked example deploys
// with no CRM connector and no key. `defineAccount` gives the standard schema
// (id, name, website, industry, number_of_employees, owner_id, …); fill it
// with `cargo-ai storage record create-bulk`, a sourcing pipeline, or swap it
// for a CRM-backed model (the `crm-backed` variation in SKILL.md).
//
// Nothing here says who is a customer. That is computed from won deals, in
// SQL, by the analyst; a "customer" flag kept by hand is a second answer to
// the same question that drifts from the deals.
//
// The three columns below are the pipeline's only writes. Read side:
// `accounts.columns.custom__<slug>`. Write side (the play): the bare slug.
