# Website visitors

Which companies visit the website, and what they read, kept current in two Cargo models. The
tracker loads only after a visitor accepts it.

```text
visitor accepts on the site
  -> the site's own Snitcher loader (profile ID only)
  -> Snitcher identifies the company from the visit
  -> website_visiting_companies + website_visitor_sessions   (Cargo, on its sync interval)
```

## Why it is built this way

**One deploy, no capture step.** Snitcher's tracker and workspace only exist once the companies
model is created. `visitingCompanies.config._trackingScript` and `._workspaceUuid` are CDK tokens,
so the sessions model and the site's env read them in the same deploy that creates them.

**The site owns its loader.** The provider's snippet is a script; the site takes only its public
profile ID from it, rejects any other shape at build time, and loads Snitcher with settings this
repository reviews: consent required, form, click, download, error and recording capture off.

**Nothing before consent.** Snitcher's own `waitForConsent` still records pageviews and sessions
before consent, so the gate does not request the tracker at all until the visitor accepts.

**Company-level by design.** An IP address resolved to an organisation. No identify call, no
person, no outreach in this skill.

## Placeholders (edit before deploy)

1. **Site URL**: `infra/models/companies.ts` `url`, the site's `canonicalUrl`.
2. **Privacy disclosure**: `site/visitors.json` `privacyPolicyUrl`, once copied into the app.
