// The auditor: how well AI agents can find, read and use the website, every
// week, and the fixes the site's own source can make.
//
// A Claude Code harness agent, because the fix is a diff to the website's
// source and only a harness has a checkout to make it in and a pull request to
// put it up for review. Merging that pull request is what deploys the fix.
//
// Ora is reached through its MCP server, not a connector: Cargo has no Ora
// integration, and the server's reads need no key. The agent keeps three of
// its tools. scan_domain and get_score read a domain's audit, and get_skill
// fetches Ora's fix playbook fresh each run, since agent standards move faster
// than this file. Every other tool is disabled: the feedback tools write to
// Ora, run_checks and a forced scan spend the daily scan budget Ora gives each
// IP, and the rest are product discovery this pipeline has no use for.
// `disabledToolSlugs` is a deny list, so a tool Ora adds later is enabled
// until it is named here.
//
// History is the readiness_scans model, one row per domain per week, because
// Ora keeps only the latest scan.
