// The ledger: one row per domain per week.
//
// Ora keeps only the latest scan of a domain, so this is the history. Last
// week's row is what "regressed", "fixed" and "competitor moved" are measured
// against, and it is also the idempotency key:
//   - `scan_id` is the ISO week plus the domain. A re-run the same week finds
//     the row and does not scan that domain again.
//   - `fix_pr_url` is set on our row once the fix pull request is open, so a
//     re-run opens no second one.
//   - `digest_ts` is set on our row after the digest posted, so a re-run posts
//     nothing.
//
// A row stores the failing check ids, not every check. Ora runs about 150; the
// ones that pass and the ones that do not apply say nothing week to week, and
// the full report is one link away.
