2026-10-07 09:40 Dana Ruiz: Procurement asked why not Globex, it's already in their stack
2026-10-07 09:52 Sam Okafor: Same thing Fabrikam said last month

The date is the thread's first message. The slug is the account (reusing the slug
`cadence/log/calls/` uses for it) or a short topic. Never edited, moved or deleted.

## Entry — `cadence/log/slack/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`

Same frontmatter and `source:` line. Then:

- two sentences on what the thread was about
- `## Objections`, `## Competitors mentioned`, `## Buying or expansion signals`, `## Product asks`,
  each item quoted and marked first-hand or interpretation
- `## Actions` as checkboxes, with the owner the thread names

## Reply

At most three lines, as the turn's final text: the entry path, the context file promoted or
"nothing promoted: first occurrence", and the pull request URL. A :white_check_mark: on the
summoning message only when the push landed.
