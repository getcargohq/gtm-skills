# Inbound qualification

The website's demo form, wired to a Cargo tool: each submission is qualified, lands in the shared
GTM accounts and contacts, is posted to Slack, and is answered on the page.

```text
visitor submits /contact/ (headless form SDK, the site's own markup)
  -> public form API: origin, honeypot, time-trap, rate limit
  -> tool inbound_form: personal email? -> company from LinkedIn -> ICP rules
       -> gtm_accounts + gtm_contacts -> Slack
  <- booking link or thank-you, when the run finishes (async: the SDK polls)

later, for each contact marked qualified (play research_qualified_leads, ships disabled)
  -> agent: ICP + tiering rubric from context, web research -> tier, brief
  -> inbound_tier / inbound_brief / inbound_rationale / inbound_researched_at on the contact
  -> one note to the same Slack channel
```

## Why it is built this way

**A tool, not a backend.** Cargo tools take a public form: the workflow's input is the field list,
`publicForm` holds the origin allow-list and the spam guards, and each submission runs the
workflow. Nothing else to host.

**The shared GTM models.** The account and the contact land in `gtm_accounts` and `gtm_contacts`,
declared exactly as every pipeline declares them, so the worked example deploys on a bare
workspace and other pipelines read the same inbound contacts. A CRM is the `crm-backed` variation.

**Cheapest refusal first.** A personal email is refused before the paid company lookup; the lookup
comes before any write. The company is enriched, never the person.

**Rules, not a model call.** Headcount band and countries from the ICP: free, explainable, the
same answer twice. An agent judgement is a variation.

**Research after the answer.** The deep research is a separate play on the contact row, never
part of the form's workflow, so the visitor never waits on a model call. It ships disabled and
runs once per qualified contact.

**The SDK loads after hydration.** Its load time is what the server's minimum fill time counts
from, so it loads when the form becomes usable. It sets its id cookie only on submit, so a visitor
who never submits gets none.

## Placeholders (edit before deploy)

1. **ICP rules**: `icpMinEmployees`, `icpMaxEmployees`, `icpCountries` in `infra/tools/inbound-form.ts`.
2. **Booking link**: `bookingUrl`.
3. **Slack channel**: `slackChannelId` in `infra/settings.ts`, shared by the form and the research
   note.
4. **Origin**: `publicForm.allowedOrigins`, the site's canonical origin.
