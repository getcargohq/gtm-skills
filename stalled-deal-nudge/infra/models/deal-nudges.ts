// The ledger: one row per deal nudged per week. `week` plus `deal_id` is the
// idempotency key.
//
// The agent leaves out any deal that already has a row for this ISO week, and
// appends rows only after the owner's digest was posted. A re-run on the same
// Monday therefore posts nothing new, and a failed post is retried by the next
// run rather than recorded as sent.
//
// It is also the memory a nudge needs: how many weeks running a deal has been
// flagged. A deal on its third Monday reads differently from one on its first,
// and only the ledger knows.
