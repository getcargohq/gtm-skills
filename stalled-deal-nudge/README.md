# Stalled-deal nudge

One Slack digest per owner every Monday, listing their open deals with no logged activity in the
last fourteen days: the line the last activity left off on, why the deal is worth a touch now, and a
follow-up drafted for them to send. The example runs on Cargo native deal, account and activity
models with no CRM connector; one agent selects the quiet deals in SQL, and a ledger keeps each deal
to one nudge per week. With deals in HubSpot, Salesforce or Attio, the models become connector-backed
and the agent stays the same.

## What it does

- Computes each open deal's last activity in SQL, as the latest logged email, meeting, call or note.
- Each Monday, selects the open deals quiet for `QUIET_DAYS` or more, and drops any already nudged
  this ISO week.
- Reads the last note, meeting or call on each, and writes a reason and a draft grounded in it.
- Posts one digest per owner to a locked channel, then records each deal in the ledger.

## Why one agent and not a play

The output is a digest grouped by owner, and grouping is a judgment over the whole list. A play
enrolls deals one at a time and would need a second step to gather them back into one post per
owner. The agent runs the selection itself, in SQL over a model that holds every deal, so the rule
is one readable query in the prompt.

## Placeholders (edit before deploy)

1. **`channelId`** in `infra/agents/nudger.ts`: the Slack channel id the digests land in.
2. **`OWNERS`** in `infra/agents/nudger.prompt.ts`: `owner_id` to the name the digest prints.
3. **`QUIET_DAYS`** in the same file: fourteen by default.
4. **The hour and timezone**: the cron (UTC) and the timezone named in the trigger `text`.
5. **`languageModel`**: any Anthropic model the workspace's connector can reach.

## Deals in a CRM

Swap `deals` and `activities` for connector-backed models that extract every record and every
column, and adapt the column names in the prompt's SQL. `SKILL.md`, `crm-backed`, maps the last
activity property for HubSpot and Salesforce.

## What it does not do

It does not write to the deal models, send the drafts, message a prospect, post anywhere but the locked
channel, or edit the workspace context.
