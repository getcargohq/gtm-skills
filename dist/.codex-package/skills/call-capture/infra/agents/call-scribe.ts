// The scribe: a Claude Code harness agent, not a streamText agent.
//
// `harnessSlug: "claudeCode"` swaps the LLM loop for the coding runtime, and
// that is what makes this skill possible. The output of a call is not a column
// value; it is a diff across the repo — a raw capture, a log entry, an
// objection file that just gained its second occurrence. Only an agent with a
// working tree can produce one, and only a pull request makes it reviewable
// before it becomes what every other agent believes.
//
// `connector` and `languageModel` are required even here. The harness does not
// bring its own model: it runs against Cargo's LLM proxy, which bills this
// connector and meters usage against this slug. Any Anthropic model works with
// `claudeCode`; see `../connectors/anthropic.ts`.
//
// This replaces a scheduled CI workflow that launched a hosted agent. One
// resource now holds the schedule, the repository binding and the
// instructions, declared in the same project as everything else the workspace
// runs.

  // No `repository` block, and nothing left to put in one. Plan and deploy
  // fill the repo, branch, root and GitHub connector from the git origin of
  // the checkout — which is the correct binding, not a shortcut: the
  // repository holding cadence/ and context/ IS this CDK project's. Declare a
  // field only to override that. `cargo-ai cdk check` prints what it resolved;
  // confirm the root is the repository root and not `infra/`, since that is
  // where the agent's `npx tsx` resolves node_modules from.
  //
  // No `env` either. The recorder and the internal domain are in
  // scripts/call-capture/collect/config.ts, where the compiler checks the slug
  // and the harness picks up an edit on its next clone. CALL_RECORDER_API_KEY
  // is a workspace environment variable the harness inherits:
  //
  //   export CALL_RECORDER_API_KEY=…   # not committed, not persisted
  //   cargo-ai workspaceManagement envVar create \
  //     --key CALL_RECORDER_API_KEY --secret
  //
  // Not `secret()`, which would resolve from the deploying machine and need
  // the key exported for every deploy. `references/providers.md` has the rest,
  // including the `<key>:<secret>` form Gong and Clari Copilot need.
