// Unify Accounts: the account row reps and every other pipeline already read.
// The score lives here, on the account, as two columns:
//
//   - `readiness_score`, a metric: the sum of `readiness_contribution` over
//     the account's Account Events.
//   - `readiness_stage`, computed from the score and the two thresholds:
//     `ready_now`, `warming` or `cold`. The segments and the play read this,
//     never the score, so moving a threshold moves every account at the next
//     rebuild with no other edit.
//
// The metric aggregates over the relationship Account Events generates
// (`account_id` → `id`). It has no uuid to reference ahead of time and cannot
// be declared, so it is named by its columns and the deploy finds it. A
// workspace whose Account Events has never synced has no relationship yet:
// the deploy says so, and the fix is one sync of Account Events.
//
// ADOPTED, NOT CREATED, and on its own schedule: hourly at :10, after Account
// Events at :00, so the sum reads contributions computed the same hour.
//
// `additionalColumns` IS THE WHOLE LIST. A deploy removes every additional
// column of Unify Accounts that is not declared here, values included, and
// every pipeline and person in the workspace reads this model. Before the
// first deploy, read the live ones (`cargo-ai storage column list` on this
// model) and copy every one the workspace keeps into this list. A project
// declares this model once.
