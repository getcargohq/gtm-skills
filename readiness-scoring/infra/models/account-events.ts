// ADOPTED, NOT CREATED. Every workspace has this model; a deploy finds it by
// its extractor and takes it over. It sets two things on it:
//
//   - `readiness_contribution`, the column above.
//   - The schedule. A sync of Account Events first syncs the models that feed
//     it, then rebuilds it and recomputes the column, so this hourly cron is
//     what moves a delivered signal into the score, and what ages the ones
//     already there. It runs at :00; Unify Accounts sums the column at :10 and
//     the play reads the stage at :20.
//
// `additionalColumns` IS THE WHOLE LIST. A deploy removes every additional
// column of this model that is not declared here, values included. Before the
// first deploy, read the live ones (`cargo-ai storage column list` on this
// model) and copy every one the workspace keeps into this list. A project
// declares this model once: another pipeline that adds columns to it adds them
// here.
