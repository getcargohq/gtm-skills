// Two Cargo Signals feeds on the accounts in `gtm_accounts`: rounds raised and
// jobs posted. Each is an ingest model: Cargo Signals pushes an event when it
// detects one, and the model never re-buys what it already holds.
//
// WATCHLIST, NOT MARKET. Both feeds watch only the accounts in `gtm_accounts`,
// matched on their website. Market scope would deliver, and bill, every round
// and every job posting in the market, most of them about companies no account
// model holds, which Account Events then drops.
//
// One feed per signal type, rather than the single account watchlist feed,
// because the score weighs by `signal_type`. The account watchlist feed tags
// every event `account_watchlist`, whatever happened, so a round and a job
// posting would weigh the same.
//
// The unification is declared, not left to the integration's default: an
// event lands in Account Events by the company's website or LinkedIn page, and
// `last_signal_date` is when it happened. That is the integration default for
// company signals today; declaring it keeps the score's input fixed if the
// default ever moves.

// delivery on a new watchlist looks back months, so a cap per day is what
// keeps the first week from costing more than the rest of the quarter.
