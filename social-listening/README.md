# Social listening

A weekly digest of the LinkedIn conversations worth joining, and the commenters in them who look
like buyers. A model buys one capped post search; an agent judges it against the ICP in the
workspace context, reads comments only on the posts it picks, and posts one digest to a locked Slack
channel. It never engages on anyone's behalf.

## What it does

- Syncs the past week's LinkedIn posts for your buyer-language keywords every Monday.
- Drops posts already surfaced, then picks at most five worth joining, each tied to a context line.
- Reads comments on those five only, and quotes up to ten commenters whose headline matches an ICP
  persona.
- Posts one digest, then records the picked posts in a ledger so none headlines twice.

## What's inside

Adds 9 resources.

| File                              | Resource                        | Role                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `infra/models/linkedin-posts.ts`  | `defineModel` (`fetchPosts`)    | the weekly, capped keyword search: what you buy           |
| `infra/models/surfaced-posts.ts`  | `defineModel` (native)          | the ledger: one row per post surfaced, no people          |
| `infra/agents/listener.ts`        | `defineAgent`                   | the cron, the reads, the comment pull, the locked post    |
| `infra/agents/listener.prompt.ts` | (not a resource)                | read context, pick, read comments, post, record           |
| `infra/connectors/linkedin.ts`    | `defineConnector` (`linkedin`)  | the search and the comment read; no engagement wired      |
| `infra/connectors/slack.ts`       | `defineConnector` (`slack`)     | the post path                                             |
| `infra/connectors/anthropic.ts`   | `defineConnector` (`anthropic`) | the model the agent runs on                               |
| `infra/folders/index.ts`          | `defineFolder` ×2               | where the agent and the models are filed                  |
| `references/digest.md`            | (not a resource)                | the digest shape and the rule for each section            |

## Why the search is in the model

The search is a paid source: it bills per post returned. That makes its query the purchase, so it
sits in the model's config with a `limit`, rather than pulling everything and narrowing in SQL. The
sync replaces the rows each week, which is why "already surfaced" lives in a separate ledger.

## Placeholders (edit before deploy)

1. **`searchKeywords`** in `infra/models/linkedin-posts.ts`: buyer-language phrases and competitor
   names from your workspace context.
2. **`channelId`** in `infra/agents/listener.ts`.
3. **`languageModel`**: any Anthropic model the workspace's connector can reach.

## What it does not do

It does not like, comment, connect, message, follow or visit a profile; store a list of people;
look anyone up beyond the comment they wrote; or post anywhere but the locked channel.
