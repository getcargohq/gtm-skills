// The listener: once a week, which public conversations are worth joining and
// who in them looks like a buyer.
//
// The model does the buying (one capped keyword search, synced Monday at 05:00
// UTC); the agent does the judging. It reads the week's posts, drops the ones
// already surfaced, picks at most five against the ICP and pains in the
// workspace context, reads comments only on those, and posts one digest.
//
// Comments, not reactions. A comment is a person saying something in public
// about the problem; a reaction is a click. `searchPostReactions` bills per
// reactor and returns no words to quote, so it is left off `uses` (the
// `with-reactions` variation in SKILL.md adds it back).
//
// No engagement action, ever. likePost, commentPost, connectProfile and
// messageProfile live on the same connector; none is on `uses`, and the
// contract fails if one is added. The digest is for a human who decides.
//
// The engagers are not stored. They appear in that week's digest, quoted from
// a public comment, and the ledger keeps only the post. A standing list of
// people who commented is a list nobody gave a basis for.
