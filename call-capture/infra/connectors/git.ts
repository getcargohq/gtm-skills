// The git provider the coding harness clones through, and pushes the branch and
// opens the pull request with. Its OAuth grant carries the `repo` scope, so this
// one connector is the agent's entire write path into the repository.
//
// Nothing imports this handle. That is deliberate: the scribe leaves
// `repository.connector` unset, and plan/deploy resolve it from the project's
// own GitHub connector — this one. Declaring it is what makes it exist; wiring
// it by hand would only re-state what the resolver already knows.
//
// Adopted, not created: authorize it once in the browser
// (`cargo-ai cdk add connector/github`) and this declaration binds to it. A
// deploy cannot mint an OAuth grant.
