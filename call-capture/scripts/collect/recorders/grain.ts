/**
 * Grain. Written from the vendor's own developer reference, not yet run
 * against a live workspace: check it with `--dry-run` before you deploy it.
 *
 * Two headers, and `Public-Api-Version` is not optional: omit it and the
 * request is rejected rather than defaulted. It is pinned below on purpose,
 * since a floating version would change response shapes under a pipeline
 * nobody is watching. The list is a POST despite being a read, and `include`
 * decides whether participants come back at all — without their emails the
 * pipeline files every call as internal.
 *
 * Grain's reference transposes `before_datetime` and `after_datetime` against
 * what their names say. They are used here the way the names read, so if
 * `--dry-run` lists a window you did not ask for, swap the two values.
 *
 * Token scope and plan requirements: `references/recorder-apis.md`.
 * Docs: https://developers.grain.com/
