# Add the CRM

The template ends at a Slack post and needs no CRM. Two variations add one,
and they are offered, not assumed: inspect the authenticated connectors, and
when a CRM is connected, say what each adds and what it costs before writing
either.

| Variation     | What it adds                                                                                                | What it costs                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crm_lookup`  | One read-only line on the Slack post: already in the CRM or not, its stage, and its owner                   | A CRM connector and one lookup per qualified person. Nothing is written                                                                |
| `crm_routing` | The CRM becomes the destination: account, contact and an owner's task, routed on what the CRM already holds | Owner IDs, a CSM field, association types and a LinkedIn field to resolve; an email lookup per person; the CRM writes are irreversible |

Both match on the domain and the LinkedIn profile in every stored form (the
lookup script below), never on one exact form: a known account read as new is
a duplicate, and on `crm_routing` a known person read as a stranger is one too.

HubSpot is the worked example for both. Salesforce and Attio change the
connector, the lookups, the routing signal, the contact key and the task
together, following the sections at the end.

## The connector and the lookup script

Add `infra/connectors/crm.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConnector } from "@cargo-ai/cdk";

// Binds the workspace's DEFAULT HubSpot connector rather than creating one:
// authorize it once (`cargo-ai cdk add connector/hubspot`) and this
// declaration resolves to it.
export const crm = defineConnector("crm", {
  integration: "hubspot",
  default: true,
});
```

and `infra/scripts/lookup.ts`, called after the company enrichment and read by
the domain guard (`if (!lookup.domain)`) in place of `company.domain`:

```ts
// What the account and person lookups search for: the enriched domain and the
// Sales Navigator profile, in every form a CRM could have stored them. A CRM
// lookup matches stored text, not normalized text, so one exact form misses the
// account stored as `www.` and the contact stored without a trailing slash, and
// the play then creates a duplicate of each.
//
// The same normalization as crm-deduplication (`scripts/contacts/identity.ts`,
// `scripts/accounts/account.ts`), so a record this play writes reads as the
// same record to the deduplication audit.

import { defineScript } from "@cargo-ai/cdk";

export const prepareLookups = defineScript(
  ({
    domain,
    linkedinProfileUrl,
  }: {
    domain: string | undefined;
    linkedinProfileUrl: string;
  }) => {
    const bareDomain = normalizeDomain(domain);
    return {
      // The domain guard reads this rather than the enrichment's raw value,
      // so a domain of `https://` alone stops the run too.
      domain: bareDomain,
      domainVariants: domainVariants(bareDomain),
      linkedinUrlVariants: linkedinUrlVariants(linkedinProfileUrl),
    };
  },
);

/** A property as text, with `""` and absence read as the same thing. */
const asText = (value: unknown): string | undefined => {
  if (value === null || value === undefined) {
    return undefined;
  }

  const text = String(value).trim();
  return text === "" ? undefined : text;
};

/** A domain as its bare host: no scheme, `www.`, path, port or trailing dot. */
const normalizeDomain = (value: unknown): string | undefined => {
  const domain = asText(value)
    ?.toLowerCase()
    .replace(/^(?:https?:\/\/)?(?:www\.)?/, "")
    .replace(/[/?#][\s\S]*$/, "")
    .replace(/:\d+$/, "")
    .replace(/\.$/, "");
  return domain === "" ? undefined : domain;
};

/** The forms a CRM could hold for one company's domain. */
const domainVariants = (domain: string | undefined): string[] => {
  if (domain === undefined) {
    return [];
  }

  return [
    domain,
    `www.${domain}`,
    `https://${domain}`,
    `https://www.${domain}`,
  ];
};

/** The forms a CRM could hold for one LinkedIn profile. */
const linkedinUrlVariants = (value: unknown): string[] => {
  const handle = asText(value)
    ?.toLowerCase()
    .replace(/^(?:https?:\/\/)?(?:[\w-]+\.)?linkedin\.com\/in\//, "")
    .replace(/[?#].*$/, "")
    .replace(/\/+$/, "");
  if (handle === undefined || handle === "") {
    return [];
  }

  return [
    `https://linkedin.com/in/${handle}`,
    `https://linkedin.com/in/${handle}/`,
    `https://www.linkedin.com/in/${handle}`,
    `https://www.linkedin.com/in/${handle}/`,
  ];
};
```

Each variant is its own `findRecords` criterion, as in crm-deduplication's
contact search: criteria are OR'd and empty values are skipped.

Then update the contract's connector inventory to include `connector:crm`, and
add the assertions the variation below names.

## `crm_lookup`: one read-only line on the post

After the gate, before the post, look the account up and say what was found:

```ts
const accounts = uses.crm.findRecords({
  objectType: "companies",
  criterias: [
    { propertyName: "domain", value: lookup.domainVariants[0] },
    { propertyName: "domain", value: lookup.domainVariants[1] },
    { propertyName: "domain", value: lookup.domainVariants[2] },
    { propertyName: "domain", value: lookup.domainVariants[3] },
  ],
});
```

and append to the post's body:

```ts
`\n\nCRM: ${accounts.length > 0 ? `in HubSpot, ${accounts[0].properties.lifecyclestage}, owner ${accounts[0].properties.hubspot_owner_id}` : "not in HubSpot"}`;
```

Nothing else changes. Add to the contract: every CRM node is a `findRecords`
or `searchRecords`, and none is a write.

Customers and accounts with an open deal are qualified by definition. If the
team wants them posted even when the qualifier would decline them, move the
lookup before the qualifier and skip it when the account is found; say that
the qualifier then no longer sees them.

## `crm_routing`: the CRM as the destination

The CRM replaces Slack as where the hand-off lands, and the same job-change
event means different things depending on what it already holds:

| The account is…                | What the play does                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not in the CRM                 | Qualifies it. If it fits: creates the account, the contact, and a task for the named owner          |
| In the CRM, open deal          | Adds the contact and a HIGH task for the owner: a new decision-maker mid-deal                       |
| A customer                     | Adds the contact and a HIGH task for the CSM to welcome them (the account owner when no CSM is set) |
| Any other stage, lead included | Adds the contact to the account. No task, no allocation                                             |

**One contact per person.** Before the routes split, the person is looked up
across the CRM by LinkedIn identity. Already a contact on this account: the run
stops before paying for an email. A contact at another company: they moved, and
that record is moved to the new account rather than duplicated. A mover's email
on file is their previous employer's, so it is replaced by the new one or
cleared, never carried over. Whether the team wants one contact per person or
one per company is asked.

What it asks for, on top of the template's inputs:

| Input               | Kind    | How it is answered                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crm`               | derived | Inspect the authenticated connectors. If more than one CRM is connected, ask which one is the system of record                                                                                        |
| `new_account_owner` | asked   | Pick from the CRM's live owner list (HubSpot owners, Salesforce users, Attio members)                                                                                                                 |
| `person_dedupe`     | asked   | One contact per person (default: a mover's record is moved) or a new contact per company                                                                                                              |
| `csm_owner_field`   | derived | The company property holding the CSM as an owner, from the live schema. Ask only when none is obvious                                                                                                 |
| `routing_signal`    | derived | HubSpot: confirm `lifecyclestage` is populated on companies. Salesforce: the opportunities. Attio: the deal stage or a status attribute                                                               |
| `contact_key`       | derived | The contact field holding a LinkedIn URL. Use the one the project's other cookbooks use (crm-deduplication reads `linkedin_url`); check the stored shape is one of the four forms the lookup searches |
| `find_email_tool`   | derived | Instantiate Cargo's native Find Email tool, confirm its live inputs and output path, and replace `REPLACE-WITH-FIND-EMAIL-TOOL-UUID`                                                                  |

What holds once it is in:

- the qualifier runs on the new-account route only, and its verdict gates every
  write on it
- the person is looked up before anything is written, and a contact on the same
  account stops the run
- every task names an owner and is attached to the account and the contact.
  HubSpot cannot attach at insert, so the association nodes stay
- lookups never use `soqlQuery`

Contract assertions to add: the qualifier sits before any CRM write, every
contact write keys on the person lookup first, no contact write carries the
found person's email, three tasks (new account, open deal, customer) each
followed on HubSpot by its company association, and no task on the
known-account route.

The worked HubSpot play, replacing `infra/plays/route-new-hires.ts`. Keep the
Slack post on the routes that raise a task if the team wants both.

## Salesforce

**Every lookup is `findRecords` or `searchRecords`. Never `soqlQuery`.** Both
take a structured filter that Cargo validates against the object's fields and
turns into a query itself, so a field that does not exist fails loudly at
design time instead of returning nothing at run time, and the lookup stays
readable in the canvas. A hand-written SOQL string escapes neither: a
misspelled field or an unquoted domain becomes a run that looks successful and
routed every person down the wrong branch.

- `findRecords` takes `criterias` (`[{propertyName, value}]`, exact match, OR
  across criterias, empty values skipped). Use it for exact keys: a contact by
  its LinkedIn field, an account by an exact domain field when the org has one.
- `searchRecords` takes the same `filter` shape as HubSpot's and supports
  `contains`, `is`, `isNot`, numeric and null operators. Use it when the match
  is not exact, such as `Website contains <domain>`.

### The account lookup

Salesforce has no domain field by default; `Website` holds a URL in whatever
form a rep typed it. Match on it with `contains`:

```ts
const accounts = uses.crm.searchRecords({
  objectType: "Account",
  limit: 1,
  filter: {
    conjonction: "or",
    groups: [
      {
        conjonction: "and",
        conditions: [
          {
            propertyName: "Website",
            operator: "contains",
            values: [lookup.domain],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

The domain guard before this lookup is not optional on Salesforce: an empty
domain makes `contains` match every account in the org, and the first one wins.
`contains` also over-matches a short domain inside a longer one (`acme.com` in
`notacme.com`), so check the pilot's matches by eye.

If the org keeps a clean custom domain field, prefer
`findRecords({ objectType: "Account", criterias: [{ propertyName: "<Domain__c>", value: lookup.domainVariants }] })`.

### The routing signal: opportunities, not `Account.Type`

`Account.Type` is frequently empty in real orgs, and a switch built on it
routes nothing. Count the values before trusting it (`listObjectFields`, then a
`searchRecords` on `Account` filtered `Type isNotNull` with a small `limit`).
The dependable signal is the opportunities themselves:

```ts
const deals = uses.crm.searchRecords({
  objectType: "Opportunity",
  limit: 50,
  filter: {
    conjonction: "or",
    groups: [
      {
        conjonction: "and",
        conditions: [
          {
            propertyName: "AccountId",
            operator: "is",
            values: [accounts[0].Id],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

Then route on what came back:

- open opportunity: `deals.some((deal) => !deal.IsClosed)`
- customer: `deals.some((deal) => deal.IsWon)`
- known account, no open deal: neither

### Contacts

Salesforce has no LinkedIn field by default. Find the org's custom field
(often `LinkedIn_URL__c`, but it varies) with `listObjectFields` on `Contact`,
and if there is none, ask before creating one: it is the key that stops the
next sync from creating the same person twice.

- person lookup, before the routes split: `findRecords({ objectType: "Contact", criterias: [{ propertyName: "<LinkedIn field>", value: lookup.linkedinUrlVariants[0] }, …] })`, one criterion per variant
- same-account stop: the found contact's `AccountId` equals the account's `Id`
- write: `upsertRecords` on `Contact`, matching `Id` when the person was found
  (a mover is moved, not duplicated), else `Email` when the email was found,
  else the LinkedIn field, with `AccountId` set to the account
- new account: `upsertRecords` on `Account` matching `Website`, with `OwnerId`
  set to the owner the operator named

### Tasks

Salesforce tasks attach at insert, so the HubSpot play's two `createAssociation`
nodes go away. `insertRecord` on `Task` with:

| Field          | Value                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Subject`      | the route's subject line                                                                                                                   |
| `Description`  | the route's body                                                                                                                           |
| `WhoId`        | the contact's `Id`                                                                                                                         |
| `WhatId`       | the open opportunity's `Id` on that route, the account's `Id` on others                                                                    |
| `OwnerId`      | the opportunity's `OwnerId` on that route; on customers the account's CSM field (often a custom user lookup), else the account's `OwnerId` |
| `Status`       | `Not Started`                                                                                                                              |
| `Priority`     | `High` or `Normal`                                                                                                                         |
| `ActivityDate` | today                                                                                                                                      |

On the open-opportunity route the task sits on the deal and goes to the deal
owner, which is where a rep working that deal will see it.

## Attio

Attio has `findRecords`, `searchRecords`, `upsertRecords`, `insertRecord` and
`createNote`, and no task action.

- the account lookup: `findRecords` on `companies` with criteria on `domains`
- the routing signal: Attio has no lifecycle stage; read the deal records
  linked to the company (the `deals` object and its stage attribute, whose
  names vary per workspace) or a company status attribute the team maintains
- contacts: `people`, found by the LinkedIn attribute before the routes split,
  and moved by updating their company relationship when they sit on another one
- the task: there is no task write, so the owner is told with `createNote` on
  the company record (title and markdown body from the route), or through the
  team's Slack connector. Say which one before deploying: a note on the record
  is visible, but nobody is notified of it

## After adapting

From this skill's folder:

```sh
node --import tsx evals/contract.mjs
```

Then from the project root: `cargo-ai cdk types && cargo-ai cdk check && cargo-ai cdk plan`. In
the pilot, take one record through each route the variation adds, with the CRM record links in the
report.
