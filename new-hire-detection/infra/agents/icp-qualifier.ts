// The qualifier: one judgment per company a new hire just joined, and the
// gate in front of the Slack post. With the `crm_routing` variation it moves to
// the new-account route only: customers and accounts with an open deal are
// qualified by definition, and scoring them again can drop an account somebody
// already sold.
//
// An agent instead of a headcount filter, because the company object carries
// more than a number: description, specialties, industry and locations. That
// is what lets it apply exclusions no filter can, such as competitors,
// agencies reselling someone else's product, holding companies, and pages that
// are not an operating business.
//
// A classifier, not a writer: temperature 0, and the output enforced by the
// JSON schema below rather than asked for in the prompt. `context` (read-only)
// is what connects it to the ICP; without it the prompt's reference to icp.md
// reads nothing and the agent invents a plausible ICP for every company. The
// step budget covers reading the ICP and answering, nothing more: it judges
// on the enriched company it is handed, never on a web search.
//
// The ICP is deliberately NOT in this prompt. It lives in the project's
// context repo (`context/icp.md` in a scaffolded project), so changing who
// qualifies is a reviewed commit rather than a deploy. The skill's own
// context/icp.md is the example to copy there.
//
// No writable model, no CRM and no Slack in reach. The agent hands back a
// verdict and the play acts on it: the gate is a branch in the workflow, never
// a choice the agent makes by writing or posting.
