// One market slice as a Sales Navigator people search. Every value is a
// PLACEHOLDER for the operator's market: the titles they sell to, the
// industries, the headcount band and the regions. Derive them from the ICP in
// the context repo when it exists; ask for them only when it does not.
//
// Facet ids are LinkedIn's, not labels. Headcount uses letters (B 1-10,
// C 11-50, D 51-200, E 201-500, F 501-1,000, G 1,001-5,000, H 5,001-10,000,
// I 10,001+). Industry and region ids come from the integration's
// autocompletes, never from memory: a wrong id is silently ignored and the
// search widens to the whole market.
//
// The three job-change filters are not part of the market and must not be
// edited away (see SKILL.md, "What should not change"):
// RECENTLY_CHANGED_JOBS, under a year at the company, and under a year in the
// position. Together they drop internal promotions, which look like a job
// change and are not one.

// One row per person who just took one of the titles above somewhere in the
// market, keyed by `linkedin_profile_id`. The play reacts to rows ADDED here,
// so a person is routed once, the first sync they appear in.
//
// `limit` is per URL and 2,500 is Sales Navigator's own ceiling for one
// search. Count the search before deploying (`searchPersonMetrics`, see
// ../../references/search.md). Above 2,500, split it by a facet (one URL per
// region or per headcount band) and list every URL in `urls`; a single URL
// over the cap returns its first 2,500 and the rest of the market is never
// seen.
//
// THE SCHEDULE RE-BUYS THE SEARCH. `fetchLeadSearch` is not incremental:
// every sync extracts and bills every lead the search returns, including the
// ones already sitting in this model. "Changed jobs" covers roughly the last
// 90 days, so a sync every two weeks re-pays for most of the previous sync to
// find the people who are new. That is the price of being systematic; the
// cadence is the dial (see "What you can change").
//
// If you deploy with a schedule and later delete the line, that does NOT clear
// the live cron: the deploy engine omits a silent field and the platform keeps
// what it has. Clear it at runtime instead:
//   cargo-ai storage model update --uuid <modelUuid> --schedule null
