// The authoritative account universe, extracted from the CRM itself. The play
// runs on this model so every row it enrolls carries the CRM's own record ID —
// the identifier `mergeRecords` expects. A native or staging model would
// introduce a second identity system, and a merge targeting the wrong one looks
// successful while nothing lands.
//
// `columnSelectionMode: "all"` keeps the properties the duplicate policy reads
// (identity keys, protected IDs, parent company, lifecycle, engagement counts)
// available without naming each one here.
