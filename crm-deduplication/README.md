# CRM deduplication

This pipeline has two independent paths. Deploy account deduplication, contact deduplication, or
both. Each path has its own CRM model, identity audit, matching and survivor policies, disabled
play, cost preview, pilot approval, and acceptance checklist. Both paths search the live CRM before
each merge decision and avoid candidate or staging models.

## Path 1: Account deduplication

The account path searches companies by LinkedIn company ID, LinkedIn company page, and non-generic
domain. Only an exact shared LinkedIn company ID without identity, protected-ID, or
parent-subsidiary conflict can merge automatically. Every other candidate reaches Human Review.

  account["CRM account"] --> search["Search live companies"]
  search --> evidence["Normalize, score, select survivor"]
  evidence --> exact{"Exact LinkedIn ID<br/>and no conflict?"}
  exact -->|yes| merge["Merge automatically"]
  exact -->|no| review["Human Review"]
  review -->|approved| merge
  review -->|declined or timeout| stop["Keep separate"]
```

### Account resources

| Resource               | Kind  | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crm_accounts`         | Model | Direct CRM company extract                               |
| `deduplicate_accounts` | Play  | Search, score, review, and merge duplicate companies     |
| Account scripts        | Code  | Normalize company identity, cluster, rank, and summarize |

Company name is excluded from candidate generation and scoring. The deterministic survivor policy
protects business IDs and prefers customer and commercial history.

## Path 2: Contact deduplication

The contact path searches people by LinkedIn person ID, normalized LinkedIn URL, exact email, and
exact stored phone. It expands direct matches with a second live search so high-confidence identity
chains form one cluster. The second search and in-cluster comparison use normalized phone values
derived from records already retrieved.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  contact["CRM contact"] --> direct["Search direct identity keys"]
  direct --> transitive["Expand keys and search again"]
  transitive --> evidence["Normalize, score, select survivor"]
  evidence --> safe{"Approved identity class<br/>and no global conflict?"}
  safe -->|yes| merge["Merge automatically"]
  safe -->|no, review enabled| review["Human Review"]
  safe -->|no, review disabled| stop["Keep separate"]
  review -->|approved| merge
  review -->|declined or timeout| stop
```

### Contact resources

| Resource               | Kind  | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `crm_contacts`         | Model | Direct CRM contact extract                                   |
| `deduplicate_contacts` | Play  | Search, score, review, and merge duplicate contacts           |
| Contact scripts        | Code  | Normalize person identity, expand clusters, rank, and review  |

Exact LinkedIn person ID, conflict-free LinkedIn URL, conflict-free non-generic email, and
conflict-free transitive chains are the automatic classes. A LinkedIn conflict, generic or shared
email, or phone-only match always leaves the automatic path. The native merge is the final CRM
write. Normalization and enrichment belong in a separate workflow.

## Install and adapt

This folder is a worked HubSpot example. Salesforce and Attio require adapting the connector,
extracts, record IDs, search and merge actions, and property slugs together. Keep one CRM shape
across selected paths.

This pipeline requires the `cargo-cdk` authoring skill:

```sh
npx skills add getcargohq/cargo-skills --skill cargo-cdk
```

From a Cargo CDK project:

```sh
cargo-ai cdk add cookbook/crm-deduplication
```

Before planning or deploying:

1. Reconcile the default CRM connector and any active Slack review connector with compatible project
   resources.
2. Choose the account path, contact path, or both. Remove unselected model and play files, then update
   the contract's exact resource inventory, connector assertions, and object-specific assertions.
3. Audit and approve each selected path independently.
4. Resolve each selected path's object-specific policy inputs, identity fields, survivor policy,
   and active review destination.
5. Typecheck, inspect the compiled graph, and deploy only approved plays disabled.
6. Request separate approval for each exact 15-row maximum merge-capable pilot.

Nothing in this folder deploys, runs, or touches customer data by itself.

## Verify

```sh
npm run typecheck
node scripts/check-pipelines.mjs
node --import tsx crm-deduplication/evals/contract.mjs
```

Use the selected sections in [the audit contract](references/audit.md),
[configuration guide](references/configure.md), [runbook](references/run.md), and
[two-path acceptance checklist](evals/acceptance.md).
